# ashlu high level comments
- clarify directory names
- clarify various arg lists

# ashlu todo
- understand logging
- look through individual processing steps

PARSE ARGS
	First, type "sbatch preprocess.sh" with flags on command line.
	This will pass all commandline args to preprocess.py
	parse_args() will create a get_base_parser() object 
		- Then argparse_utils will add all the possible arguments it may expect
		- Finally, those command line arg will be parsed.
		- These now exist in "args"
	Next, modules are loaded with setup_modules()
	Do some initial directory parsing *let's review this...
	Then setup logging with setup_logging() (and add to args)
	read and parse settings file (and add to args) (based on a flag either load default or user settings)

BUILD FLIES
	Ask args if should build fly
	BUILD
	setup_build_dirs()
	build_fly()

PROCESS FLIES
	process_fly()
		1. build workflow_dict
			- for each potential/supported/available processing step, make a dict entry like
			workflow_dict['fictrac_qc']
			First manually add some needed args like directory names
			Then add args previously read from settings file into "args"
		2. loop over each processing step in workflow_dict
			- call run_preprocessing_step()
				parse dirtype
				remove_existing_file_handlers()
				loop over directories to process
